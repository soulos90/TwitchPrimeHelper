# **Twitch Prime Subscription Assistant - Design Document**

## **Project Overview**
**Purpose:**
The Twitch Prime Subscription Assistant is a React Native mobile app designed to simplify the process of using Amazon Prime’s free Twitch subscription. The subscription must be manually renewed every 30 days, making it easy to forget. The app will guide users through the process step-by-step and provide timely reminders to ensure they use their free subscription consistently.

**Why is this process cumbersome?**
- **Manual Process:** Twitch does not provide an automatic way to renew Prime subscriptions.
- **Multiple Steps Involved:** Users must verify their Amazon Prime link, find an eligible streamer, and navigate to the correct Twitch page each time they subscribe.
- **UI Differences:** The Twitch interface varies slightly between iOS and Android, leading to confusion.
- **Easily Forgotten:** Users often forget to resubscribe, missing out on their free subscription benefits.
- **No Browser Awareness:** The app cannot track browser activity, so users must manually mark steps as completed.

**Reminder delay option:** Users will have a "Delay 1 Day" button alongside the resubscription reminder.
**Comprehensive onboarding:** The onboarding process should be as detailed as possible to ensure ease of use.
**Accessibility features:** Additional features for visually impaired users should be considered, though specific requirements are unknown.
